                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Training</h3>
                   <p class="mb-6">
                      The goal of the CCD training to get you thinking like an Analyst, and a smart one at that. Critical thinking, research, and problem solving were all highly relevant mindsets that were fostered throughout this course. This is exemplified in one of the first lessons, where a quotes is given:
                    </p> 
                    <p class="text-center italic text-lg mb-6">
                      "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime"
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                      My goal, especially with the labs, was not to simply "capture the flag" for one of the questions, but to slow down, ask questions, and do my due dilligence in researching and verifying the answer. I attribute this style of thinking to how the training and labs are set up by the CyberDefenders team. The course's content is rich in knowledge and highly practical, with many external readings attached, ensuring that I fully understood the topic before moving on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                      The labs were challenging, and expected you to work out problems on your own and build mental resillience. This was one of my favorite parts of the training though - it was the fact that the challenge was hard that made finding answers and connecting the dots so rewarding.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                      Throughout the training, I gained hands-on experience with various industry-standard security tools. The threat hunting section, in particular, provided deep exposure to SIEM solutions like Splunk and ELK (Elastic Stack). What made this training especially valuable was its emphasis on developing a critical thinking and problem-solving mindset. This approach meant that transitioning between different toolsâ€”like moving from Splunk to ELKâ€”became natural, as I had learned the core methodologies needed to effectively utilize the tools.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Exam</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                      While I'll keep the specific exam details private to maintain its integrity, I can confidently say that the training thoroughly prepares you for the certification. Though challenging, the exam fairly reflects the course material and methodology. Success comes naturally if you engage with the content and embrace the course's core philosophy of "defend smarter, not harder" during the labs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                      Two aspects of the exam particularly stand out: its departure from traditional multiple-choice testing and its real-world approach to answer verification. Without immediate feedback on submissions, you're required to thoroughly analyze and cross-reference all evidenceâ€”just as you would in a real security investigation. This design brilliantly mirrors actual security analysis work, where certainty comes from thorough investigation rather than simple validation.

                <div class="prose max-w-none">
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        Looking back, this certification really changed the way I think about security analysis. It's not just another cert to add to your profile - it's a genuine learning experience that pushes you to think critically and solve problems creatively. The hands-on labs and real-world scenarios were challenging, but that's exactly what made them worthwhile.

  Welcome to Tailwind Play, the official Tailwind CSS playground!

  Everything here works just like it does when you're running Tailwind locally
  with a real build pipeline. You can customize your config file, use features
  like `@apply`, or even add third-party plugins.

  Feel free to play with this example if you're just learning, or trash it and
  start from scratch if you know enough to be dangerous. Have fun!
