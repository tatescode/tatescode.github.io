Hello! My name is Tate, I am passionate about securing systems and networks and am aiming to enter the field of Cybersecurity, specifically as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. 

This site primarily contains projects and documentation that showcase my skills - but will also include some documentation and writeups for certain tools and software.

# Projects

| Projects        | Tools/Technology          | Purpose |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| [Threat Hunting](./threathunting/)  | RITA, Velociraptor, Elastic | References for threat hunting tools and techniques  |
| [Scripting](./Scripting)/           | Python, BASH, PowerShell    | Practical scripts used for automation               |
| [Wireshark[(./Wireshark/)           | WireShark                   | Malicious network traffic analysis with Wireshark   |

## Use Cases
* The creation of this page serves as documentation of my personal learning journey, as well as a respository for certain projects. However, anyone can use and benefit from the open-source projects and documentation in this repository.
* Some scripts and projects may be geared towards red team activities (e.g. penetration testing). In this case, do not use or distribute the software for purposes other than learning. I do not condone the use of hacking TTP's for malicious use.
