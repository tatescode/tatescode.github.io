Hello! My name is Tate, I am passionate about securing systems and networks, and am aiming to enter the field of Cybersecurity, specifically as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. 

This site primarily contains projects and documentation that showcase my skills - but will also include some documentation and writeups for certain tools and software.
